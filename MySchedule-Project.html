        <h3>Assignment Description:</h3>
        <p>Create a page to display your course schedule using a table.&nbsp; classes
            and times do not have to be real. Make things ups</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All your css style rules should be on an external style sheet</li>
            <li>Your page MUST look PROFESSIONAL &amp; POLISHED - a minimum of a "C" will be
                earned on pages that look incomplete, or unpolished (think about the Good
                Website / Bad Website assignment)
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider what elements you need to include to make this page look like a
                        page you thought was a good website. Ask yourself, if YOU landed on this
                        page after a Google search, what would YOU think of the page's polish
                        and professionalism.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Create a table that displays your course schedule – what class/times you are
                taking
                <ul>
                    <li>There should be 5 columns, one for each day of the week</li>
                    <li>Create a header that spans across all 5 columns</li>
                    <li>Create a minimum of 4 additional rows *</li>
                    <li>Experiment with CSS Styling rules.
                        http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp
                        <ul>
                            <li>A minimum of 3 different stylings should be applied to your
                                table. Here are some ideas to look up.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>width</li>
                                    <li>border</li>
                                    <li>padding</li>
                                    <li>text‐align</li>
                                    <li>border‐radius</li>
                                    <li>border‐image:linear‐gradient</li>
                                    <li>box-shadow and/or text-shadow</li>
                                    <li>margin</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Make sure your pages work (validate!!!) before you turn it in
                                (both css &amp; html). A MINIMUM of a "D"&nbsp; will be earned
                                if any page does not validate. (Warnings are ok). If you are
                                unsure, ask me. For example The validator will give an error if
                                you incorporate google fonts. I would not dock you for that.
                                &nbsp;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Grading Rubric:</p>
        <p>A - Page validates, looks polished, all criteria met<br>B- Page validates and all
            criteria met, however, lacks polish. (Remember good website/bad website)<br>C -
            Pagevalidates, however, not&nbsp; all criteria was met<br>D - Does not validate, all
            criteria met<br>F- Does not validate, criteria not met</p>
